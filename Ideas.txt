Genomatrix:

Ideas:
- Separate Model and View of BoxGameModel and GameWindow.
- Separate Metrics and View
- Add Genes, GeneFactory, and other Games
- Allow any number of bits (BigInteger).
- Code optimization (mapPairsExclusive)
- Specific color models (one for last two move niceness)
   - Forgiveness
   - Retaliation
   - Parent
- Automatically keep N top best algorithms to analyze
- Allow for sources and sinks (unchanging genome, use for memetics?)
- Superrationality / Self-preservation for optimization.
- Two layer board (Meme model?)

? Translate to Ruby, Groovy, or Python for dynamic type casting
? 3D model for graphics
